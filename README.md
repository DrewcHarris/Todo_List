# Simple Todo List

## Introduction

This is one of the projects built during [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).

## Completed Project

You can view the fully working project [here](http://codepen.io/drewharris/full/oWvNpB/).

## How To Use
As a user, you can add a todo by typing text in the "New Todo" box and hitting "enter".  From there, you can click on a todo in the list to mark it as done or if you hover over the todo, you can select the trash icon to delete the todo from your list.

This is a basic front-end project only.  There is no DB hooked up to keep track of your todos or anything like that, so don't expect your items to be saved (yet!).
